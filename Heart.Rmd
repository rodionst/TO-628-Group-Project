**Introduction**

Of all the applications of machine-learning, diagnosing any serious disease using a black box is always going to be a hard sell. If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the absence of treatment, people are going to want to know *why*.

This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. Below, the data is first tried to be predicted using a losgistic regression model, then a random forest model. However, decision tree is selcted as the mode appropriate model.

**Data Description**
age: The person's age in years

sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

**Thal description**
Nuclear stress testing requires the injection of a tracer, commonly technicium 99M (Myoview or Cardiolyte), which is then taken up by healthy, viable myocardial cells. A camera (detector) is used afterwards to image the heart and compare segments. A coronary stenosis is detected when a myocardial segment takes up the nuclear tracer at rest, but not during cardiac stress. This is called a "reversible defect." Scarred myocardium from prior infarct will not take up tracer at all and is referred to as a "fixed defect."
